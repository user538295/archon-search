# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`archon-search` is a standalone hybrid retrieval + routing server: LanceDB vector store, fastembed dense embeddings, a cross-encoder reranker, a multi-collection router, FastAPI HTTP control plane, and an MCP endpoint sharing the same auth. Runtime state lives under `~/.archon-search/`.

- Python `>=3.12`, managed with `uv`.
- Package name: `archon-search` (PyPI), import name: `archon_search`.
- Version is derived from git tags via `hatch-vcs` (CalVer `YY.M.<rev-count>`); never hardcode versions.

## Common commands

```bash
# Dev install
uv sync --dev

# Run the server (entry point archon_search.cli.main:main)
uv run archon-search

# Full test suite (default addopts enforce --cov-fail-under=85)
uv run pytest

# Single test file / single test
uv run pytest tests/test_router.py
uv run pytest tests/test_router.py::test_name -x

# Skip coverage locally (developer override only — never bake into addopts)
uv run pytest --no-cov

# Marker-gated suites (excluded from default run)
uv run pytest -m eval --thresholds-path tests/eval/thresholds.toml tests/eval/test_eval_suite.py
uv run pytest -m integration
uv run pytest -m live
uv run pytest -m benchmark   # needs a running server; auto-skips if unreachable

# Cut a release (tag + push; CI runs eval + publishes to PyPI via OIDC)
bash release.sh           # interactive
bash release.sh -y        # non-interactive
bash release.sh --dry-run
```

Plain pushes to `main` do **not** publish. Only a tag push (typically via `release.sh`) triggers `archon-search-release.yml`.

## Architecture

### Core retrieval pipeline (`archon_search/`)

The runtime is a layered pipeline; understanding the seam between these modules is the fastest way to navigate the codebase:

- `parser.py` → `chunker.py` → `embedder.py` → `store.py` (LanceDB vector + FTS) → `reranker.py` (cross-encoder second stage) → `pipeline.py` (`SearchPipeline` orchestrates ingest, search, and context retrieval).
- `router.py` (`MultiCollectionRouter`) does centroid pre-ranking across collections to pick which to query for a given prompt.
- `collection_meta.py`, `description_generator.py`, `acl.py` add per-collection metadata, auto-generated descriptions, and access control.
- `watcher.py` + `sync.py` keep on-disk corpora and the index in sync (watchdog-driven).
- `jobs/` is the async job store (model + store) used by long-running ingest/reindex operations exposed over the API.
- `key_manager.py` owns the API-key bootstrap (auto-generates `~/.archon-search/.search.env` with mode 600 on first start; `ARCHON_SEARCH_API_KEY` env overrides; `ARCHON_SEARCH_KEY_FILE` redirects).
- `config.py` + `constants.py` load `~/.archon-search/archon-search.toml` (see `archon-search.toml.example`).
- `platform/` (`runtime.py`, `service.py`, `macos.py`, `linux.py`, `windows.py`) handles OS-specific service install/uninstall; `install.py` + `cli/install_cmd.py` wire it to the CLI.

### Server (`archon_search/server/`)

`app.py` builds the FastAPI app; `mcp.py` exposes the same control-plane tools over MCP using the shared auth middleware (`middleware_auth.py`). All endpoints except `GET /health` require a `Bearer` token.

Routes are split per resource: `routes_health.py`, `routes_state.py`, `routes_status.py`, `routes_search.py`, `routes_route.py`, `routes_collections.py`, `routes_jobs.py`, `routes_telemetry.py`, `routes_explain.py`. `schemas.py` + `schemas_telemetry.py` are the Pydantic request/response models. `GET /openapi.json` is the authoritative API contract — keep it in sync, and record breaking changes in `BREAKING.md`.

MCP tools (registered in `mcp.py`, 10 total): `search`, `search_with_context`, `explain`, `ingest_file`, `ingest_directory`, `list_collections`, `get_collections_meta`, `get_collection_meta`, `list_documents`, `delete_document`. They share the REST auth layer but their names do not mirror the REST routes 1:1 — consult `mcp.py` as the source of truth.

### CLI (`archon_search/cli/`)

`main.py` is the `archon-search` entry point (Click). Subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `status`, `ingest`, `sync`, `collection`, `config_cmd`, `install_cmd`. `_helpers.py` is shared CLI infrastructure.

### Telemetry (`archon_search/telemetry/`)

Opt-in and **disabled by default**. `writer.py` appends one JSONL line per call to `~/.archon-search/search-logs/`, `reader.py` powers `/telemetry/stats` and `/telemetry/entries`, `pruner.py` enforces `retention_days`. **Structural invariant: factory methods in `entry.py` do not accept a `query` parameter — raw query strings must never be logged.** `export_enabled = true` is not implemented in v1: the config loader logs a warning and silently coerces it to `false` (see `config.py`). No external transmission occurs in v1. `doc_id`s are path-derived and may leak filesystem paths when telemetry is on; this is documented as accepted risk.

### Evaluation harness (`archon_search/eval/` + `tests/eval/`)

`tests/eval/` is the sanctioned regression gate for retrieval / reranking / routing / latency changes. Fixtures: `documents.jsonl`, `queries.jsonl`, `labels.jsonl`, `corpus/`, `routing/`. Thresholds in `thresholds.toml`, baseline in `baselines/baseline.{md,json}`. The harness uses **deterministic, corpus-aware but label-blind backends** (`archon_search/eval/backends.py`) so metrics are stable without real model weights; latency p50/p95 is a regression guard, not a production SLA. The maintenance guide (fixture schemas, threshold-lowering policy, waivers) is `tests/eval/README.md` — read it before changing thresholds or fixtures.

## Repository conventions

- Default pytest run excludes `live`, `eval`, `benchmark`, `integration` markers. Coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=85`) applies to the default single-run invocation. Split / matrix CI runs MUST `coverage combine` before applying the threshold; never bake `--no-cov` into `addopts`.
- The package directory is `archon_search/` (underscore), the distribution is `archon-search` (hyphen). `pyproject.toml` `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel].packages` is explicit about this — don't "fix" it.
- Breaking REST/MCP changes go in `BREAKING.md`.
- Telemetry's no-raw-query guarantee is structural: do not add a `query` parameter to telemetry entry constructors.

## Documentation map

Full project documentation lives under `Documentation/`. Treat the **source code as the single source of truth**; the docs are explanatory and may lag. When a doc and the code disagree, fix the doc.

Start here when picking up a task:

- `Documentation/Architecture/990_documentation_index_and_contribution_guide.md` — index of every doc with one-line descriptions and review cadence.
- `Documentation/Architecture/100_system_architecture_overview.md` — C4 diagrams and the layered pipeline overview.
- `Documentation/Architecture/110_component_catalog_and_layer_breakdown.md` — every module mapped to its layer with key public symbols.
- `Documentation/Architecture/600_api_reference_or_public_interface.md` — exhaustive REST + MCP + CLI surface (the live OpenAPI at `GET /openapi.json` is authoritative for HTTP).

When generating, refactoring, or reviewing code: open the relevant Architecture doc first for context, then verify against source. When making a behavior change that the docs describe (auth, telemetry, routing, schemas, API surface), update the docs in the same PR. ADRs are append-only — supersede with a new ADR rather than editing accepted ones.
